Prediction using Supervised ML


PROBLEM: Predict the percentage of a student based on the no.of study hours.
This is simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. 
You can use R,Pyton,SAS,Enterprise miner or any other tool. 
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data To predict: The score if a student studies for 9.25hrs/day 

Solution: The given data consist of two variable i.e Hours and Scores.
Hours here is independent variable while scores is a dependent variable.
In this prediction we have used different libraries to implement the regression function.
